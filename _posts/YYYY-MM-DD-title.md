# My First Blog Post

Welcome to my blog! In this post, I'll share some tips on creating beautiful Markdown files for GitHub Pages.

## Headers

Use `#` for different levels of headers:

## Lists

Organize information with ordered or unordered lists:

1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item

## Code Blocks

Display code snippets using backticks or triple backticks:

```python
def greet():
    print("Hello, World!")
