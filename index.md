# My Awesome Blog

## Introduction

Welcome to my blog! In this post, I'll share some tips on creating beautiful Markdown files.

## Table of Contents

- Headers
- Lists
- Code Blocks
- Links
- Images

## Headers

Use `#` for different levels of headers:

```markdown
# Heading 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3

`print("Hello, World!")`

```python
def greet():
    print("Hello, World!")


## Links

Add links to external websites or other files:

```markdown
Visit GitHub
Link to another Markdown file


Remember to adjust the content according to your preferences. Once you've crafted your `index.md`, commit it to your repository, and your beautiful GitHub blog will be ready!
